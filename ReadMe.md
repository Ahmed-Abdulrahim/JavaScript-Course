## 📌 About This Repository  

This repository documents my **JavaScript learning journey** 🧠.  
I will be uploading code snippets, exercises, small projects, and notes as I progress.  
The goal is to **learn JavaScript step by step** and become comfortable with both **fundamentals** and **advanced topics**.
